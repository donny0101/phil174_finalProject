            The Dutch government wanted to more efficiently analyze people applying for child care benefits through an 
            machine learning algorithm that assessed applicants based on  “risk indicators” that ended up punishing some 
            families even if they had a false fraud allegation. This forced many families to give up their children to foster 
            care as the algorithm wrongly classified these applicants as risky.
