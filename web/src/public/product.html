        <h1>explains the goal of your data science effort (i.e., what is the real-world problem that your effort would 
            hopefully help to address)
        </h1>
        <div>
            The Dutch government wanted to more efficiently analyze people applying for child care benefits through an 
            machine learning algorithm that assessed applicants based on  “risk indicators” that ended up punishing some 
            families even if they had a false fraud allegation. This forced many families to give up their children to foster 
            care as the algorithm wrongly classified these applicants as risky.  

        </div>

        <h2>outlines a proposed data collection and measurement system for this effort</h2>
        <div>I will still have to do further research about the exact collection efforts that were used in the designing of 
            the algorithm, but from my initial findings it looks like tax authority reports caused the error bias to occur. 
        </div>

        <h1>
            identifies at least two significant ethical and/or societal concerns about this collection & measurement system
        </h1>
        <div>
            One reason why the Dutch algorithm failed was miscommunication between the programming team and officials that used 
            the system. The system accidentally emphasized some parts of the applicant's profile as riskier than necessary, 
            causing unnecessary pain for the families involved.
        </div>
        <h2>
            provides responses to those concerns
        </h2>
        <div>
            The miscommunication problems seen in the Dutch childcare scandal aren’t unique. Whenever machine learning 
            techniques are applied to real-world situations, the data that is put into the system may still create a bias as 
            the system is working to solve one issue but may exaggerate current problems inherent in the system.
